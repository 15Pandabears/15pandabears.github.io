My name is Alexander Pan, and I go by Alex. I study computer science at UC Berkeley. 

I maintain an [academic website](https://aypan17.github.io); this is my personal blog. If you are interested in my academic profile, please visit the aforementioned site instead, thanks! 

The blog's theme and layout is based off of [Daniel Seita's blog](https://danieltakeshi.github.io).
