My name is Alexander Pan, and I go by Alex. I study computer science at UC Berkeley. 

I maintain an [academic website](https://aypan17.github.io); this is my personal blog. If you are interested in my academic profile, please visit the aforementioned site instead, thanks! 

The blog's is partially inspired by [Daniel Seita's blog](https://danieltakeshi.github.io). I used [Simon Dosda's tutorial](https://simondosda.github.io/posts/2021-09-13-blog-github-pages-1-introduction.html) to create this.
